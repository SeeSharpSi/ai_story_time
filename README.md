# Saga Forge

Saga Forge is an interactive, text-based adventure game powered by Google's Gemini AI. Players craft a unique story by responding to AI-generated scenarios, with their choices directly shaping the narrative, the items they discover, and the world they explore.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Storytelling:** Every story is dynamically generated by the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, creating a unique and unpredictable experience every time you play.
*   **Interactive World:** Interact with characters, pick up items, and use them to solve problems. The AI understands when you acquire and use items, and your inventory is tracked automatically.
*   **Game Over & Restart:** The story can end based on your choices, with a simple "restart" command to begin a new adventure.
*   **Dynamic UI:** The interface is built with Go, HTMX, and Templ, providing a seamless, single-page experience without the need for a heavy frontend framework.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Go (using the standard `net/http` library)
*   **Frontend:** HTMX & `a-h/templ`
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
*   **Styling:** Plain CSS

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Saga Forge running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Go 1.21 or later installed on your machine.
*   A Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeeSharpSi/ai_story_time
cd story_ai
```

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory. This file will hold your Gemini API key.

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.

### 4. Run the Application

Start the application by running the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
go run .
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9779`.

## How to Play

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9779`.
2.  You will be greeted with a welcome screen. Click the "Begin" button to start your adventure.
3.  The AI will generate the first page of the story. Read the text and decide what you want to do next.
4.  Type your response (15 words or less) into the input box and click "Send".
5.  The story will continue to unfold based on your choices. Good luck!

## Future Ideas

*   **Character Stats:** Introduce character attributes like health, strength, or magic that can influence the story's outcome.
*   **Saving & Loading:** Implement a system to save your story's progress so you can return to it later.
*   **Image Generation:** Use the Gemini model's image generation capabilities to create visuals for key scenes in the story.
*   **WebSockets:** For a more real-time experience, the application could be refactored to use WebSockets instead of HTMX's polling mechanism.
